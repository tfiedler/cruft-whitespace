Creates 3 VMs 1 load balancer - uses IPTables
              2 web servers

after creation you should be able to browse to 192.168.50.2 which will load balance between .20 and .30

SO... Download vagrant. Drop these files in a directory

cd into <directory>
vagrant up
# Wait...
vagrant status

Using this method I can reliably acheive true RR load balancing.

<code>
for i in `seq 1 10000` ; do curl 192.168.50.2 >> results.txt; done

sort results.txt | uniq -c
5000 Server created: Wed May  7 11:37:13 UTC 2014
5000 Server created: Wed May  7 11:38:57 UTC 2014
</code>

to favor one over the other you can play some tricks in POSTROUTING by modifying script.sh

<code>
-A PREROUTING -m state --state NEW -m statistic --mode nth --every 4 -j web1
-A PREROUTING -m state --state NEW -m statistic --mode nth --every 3 -j web1
-A PREROUTING -m state --state NEW -m statistic --mode nth --every 2 -j web1
-A PREROUTING -m state --state NEW -m statistic --mode nth --every 1 -j web2
<code>

using the above method I acheived the following rsults

<code>
for i in `seq 1 10000` ; do curl 192.168.50.2 >> results.txt; done

sort results.txt | uniq -c
7500 Server created: Wed May  7 11:37:13 UTC 2014
2500 Server created: Wed May  7 11:38:57 UTC 2014
