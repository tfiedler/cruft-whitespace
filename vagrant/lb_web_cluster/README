Creates 3 VMs 1 load balancer - uses IPTables
              2 web servers

after creation you should be able to browse to 192.168.50.2 which will load balance between .20 and .30

SO... Download vagrant. Drop these files in a directory

cd into <directory>
vagrant up
# Wait...
vagrant status

Using this method I can reliably acheive true RR load balancing.

<code>
for i in `seq 1 10000` ; do curl 192.168.50.2 >> results.txt; done

sort results.txt | uniq -c
5000 Server created: Wed May  7 11:37:13 UTC 2014
5000 Server created: Wed May  7 11:38:57 UTC 2014
